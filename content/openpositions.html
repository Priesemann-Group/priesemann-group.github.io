            To study the self-regulation of social networks and the spread of (mis)information, we curated a large social-media data set (Telegram), which allows novel insights into the spread of information and misinformation. Complementarily, we make use of the outbreak of COVID-19, which posed a major challenge to societies and individuals – but also provided research with an extremely rich behavioral and epidemiological data set to study collective human behavior.  If you want to join our team as PostDoc, or independent Fellow to develop your own research profile in our group with your own students, let us know. We can offer a long research perspective (3+3 years), a vibrant team, and highly motivated students.

              We are seeking an enthusiastic and talented PhD candidate to join a collaborative project between CASUS–HZDR (Görlitz, Germany) and the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (Göttingen, Germany), jointly supervised by Ricardo Martinez-Garcia and Viola Priesemann.
            </p>
            <p>  
              The project will investigate the resilience of water-limited ecosystems under global change scenarios. In particular, we aim to understand the relationships between spatial self-organization and ecosystem resilience, both in simulated and remote-sensing data, and using a combination of pattern-formation theory, functional network analysis, and Bayesian inference tools. The position is based primarily at CASUS (Görlitz), with regular research stays in Göttingen. The starting date is flexible, but should be as soon as possible.            </p>

The network comprises a highly interdisciplinary consortium of psychologists, biologists as well as systems and computational neuroscientists who will work together to answer three broad research questions: (A) When are we curious? (B) Why are we curious? and (C) How are we curious? Please note that we do not advertise all the positions simultaneously, so please consult the webpage below frequently.
